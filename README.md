A small, local-first haiku editor with live syllable counting.
Runs as a single HTML file. No accounts, no tracking, no backend.

## Features
- Write and save haikus (5–7–5 by default)
- Live syllable counting (English and Spanish, heuristic)
- Local storage in the browser
- Export/import library as JSON
- Download individual or all haikus as Markdown

## How to use
1. Download `five-seven-five.html`
2. Open it in your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
3. Write haikus
4. Export regularly if you care about backups

For Obsidian users:
- Save downloaded `.md` files into your vault
- Or keep `five-seven-five.html` inside your vault and open it in a browser

## Important
Haikus are stored locally in your browser.
Clearing browser data will remove them.
They won’t sync between browsers or devices.

#### Export regularly if you care about keeping them.

## About syllable counts
Syllable counts are approximations.
They will occasionally be wrong.
Poetry is allowed to disagree.

## Customisation
This is a single-file project.
Edit the HTML/CSS/JS directly to:
- Change colours
- Adjust layout
- Tweak syllable rules

No framework knowledge required.
